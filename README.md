# DesignPrinciplesGeneNetworks
A collection of functions and tools to analyze Boolean gene regulatory networks

This repository contains code to perform the analyses described in this paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01216](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01216). 
Most functionality is also implemented on the interactive project website [https://booleangenenetworks.math.iastate.edu](https://booleangenenetworks.math.iastate.edu).
